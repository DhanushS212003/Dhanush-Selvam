					<h2> <ins>About me</ins> </h2>

<p>I am <b>Dhanush</b>. I was born in <b>Tiruvannamalai</b> on <b>02/12/2003</b> and our family shifted to Chennai. 
I completed my 12th standard and am not interested to joining College. Because, nowadays skills are bigger than degree in this generation. 
So I waited a few months to make something different than the others. At that time, I tried so many things to learn in online but just going deeper into the lessons, 
I find difficult to understand it and not able to rectify my doubts. Then I choose a new topic to learn but the same problem repeats me. 
This may happens for a year. <strong>After one year, I joined the Freshworks Software Academy.</strong> I didn't expect by getting an opportunity in the academy. 
So now I want to work hard and get a lot of knowledge. I don't lose this opportunity to upgrade my career. This is my turning point of my life.<p> 

<h2> <ins>About my family</ins> </h2>

<p>There are four members in my family including me.
<ol>
<li>R.Selvam - My father - Owns a Xerox shop.</li>
<li>S.Ramani - My mother - House wife.</li>
<li>S.Ashok - My brother - College student.</li></ol></p>

<h2> <ins>My Dream</ins> </h2>

<p>My aim is to become an <i><b>entrepreneur</i></b>. For that, I want some knowledge and experience in the industry. So, I want to thank Freshworks for giving me this wonderful opportunity. 
I going to learn more with my friends. Once I started my startup, I would like to move to my home town and work from there. I love to play and watch cricket. 
So, I like to build a cricket field with grass on the surface of the ground in my village. After building such a ground, I would like to play with my friends. 
My favourite cricket player is <b>Virat Kolhi</b> and I like to meet him. My another wish is to travel some places of the world with my family and friends.<p>
